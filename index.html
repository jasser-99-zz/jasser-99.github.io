				<h2 class="section-title">Media Queries</h2>
				Media queries are needed to make a site function at responsive speed.From this project I was able to learn a lot anout how to set the dimensions for mobile device.I love tinkering around with the code until I get it just right.The pro of media queries is that you really need it to make a site function efficiently and well.Very simple to write, I really don't see any disadvantage to media queries.

			  <h2 class="section-title">Resume with Skeleton</h2>
		  I used the Skeleton Framework for my resume and it turned pretty nice to use.Looking at the css is a pretty simple way to do the grid system and I like the style they have for the icons.It didn't take long to learn and very easy to use.Really can't see a disadvantage to Skeleton it's a very straight forwardf to learn.Comparing this to media queires I would say they are both equally needed for a website .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

        <!--  Flexbox -->

          <div class="col-2">
            <h2 class="section-title">Flexbox Framework</h2>
            Flexbox was easy to learn after a quick couple videos and what I can tell you immediately is that it is better than skeleton. Flexbox has fewer lines of codes and I didn't have to make a lot of changes for every resolution.It was easy to make layouts for different sized screens.I would use flexbox over skeleton because of its simplicity and responsiveness. </div>

                <h2 class="section-title">Bootstrap</h2>
           Bootstrap was very good .The grid system is immaculate and the code was very straight forward.This probably one of the nicest one I've use out of the three.The responsiveness is very good and is mobile friendly.Only con was learning did take a little time but having knowledge in html or css and it gets pretty easy after that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
